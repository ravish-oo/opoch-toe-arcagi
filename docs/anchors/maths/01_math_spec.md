Final Covers everything:
ARC-AGI 2 — Final Math Spec (100% deterministic, receipts-first)

Audience: a careful junior engineer.
Goal: solve all ARC-AGI2 tasks deterministically “from math,” in seconds, with zero heuristics.
Core idea: represent colors as bit-planes; let every learned rule emit admissible color sets per pixel; compute the least fixed point (LFP) under intersection and exact constraints; then pick one color per pixel by a frozen, scope-gated precedence. Every decision is logged as a receipt.

⸻

0) Contract (non-negotiables)
	1.	No guessing. If any proof cannot be established on the trainings exactly, fail-closed with a receipt explaining why.
	2.	Receipts-first. “If it’s not logged, it didn’t happen.” Every key quantity (planes, transforms, matches, hashes, choices) is recorded.
	3.	Determinism. Sort orders, tie chains, and iterations are frozen; a double run must produce identical hashes for every section.
	4.	No floats in logic. FFT/NTT can generate candidates, but accept only when exact pixel equality is verified.
	5.	Monotone core. Domains can only shrink; the LFP exists and is unique (Knaster–Tarski).
	6.	Containment & idempotence. The chosen color at each pixel must be in the final domain, and repaint once must be identical.

⸻

1) Objects, shapes, bit-planes
	•	A grid G:\Omega\to\mathcal C, \Omega=\{0,\ldots,H-1\}\times\{0,\ldots,W-1\}, \mathcal C\subset\mathbb Z_{\ge 0} colors.
	•	Bit-planes. For color c\in\mathcal C, define B_c(G)[p]=\mathbf 1\{G[p]=c\}. We pack bit rows into uint64 words for speed; math sees them as Booleans.

Color universe (frozen):
\mathcal C\ :=\ \{0\}\ \cup\ \bigcup_i \mathrm{colors}(X_i)\ \cup\ \bigcup_i \mathrm{colors}(Y_i).
We always include 0 (bottom color) so “select bottom” never violates containment.

⸻

2) Normalization: sizes & frames (once per task)

2.1 LCM size normalization (handles variable output sizes)
	•	Trainings must be comparable on a common output canvas. Let training outputs have sizes (R_i,C_i).
	•	Compute R_{\rm lcm}=\mathrm{lcm}i R_i,\ C{\rm lcm}=\mathrm{lcm}_i C_i.
	•	Define normalized outputs Y’_i by block replication:
Y’_i[r,c] = Y_i\big(\lfloor r/s^{(r)}i\rfloor,\ \lfloor c/s^{(c)}i\rfloor\big),\quad s^{(r)}i=R{\rm lcm}/R_i,\ s^{(c)}i=C{\rm lcm}/C_i.
No interpolation, just exact replication. This guarantees a common canvas (R{\rm lcm},C{\rm lcm}) for unanimity/lattice layers.

Receipts: lcm_shape, per-training scale_factors, upscale_hashes, and a proof hash that down-replication restores Y_i.

2.2 Two frames (rigid poses) — inputs vs outputs

We distinguish engine frame (for learning input→output mapping) and output frame (for voting/consensus on the common canvas).
	•	Π_in (engine frame) — per input grid:
	•	Choose D4 pose R (8 options; lex-min raster) and anchor offset a (top-left nonzero → origin).
	•	Pose matrices are frozen (see §4.3). Colors remain original integers, not palette codes.
	•	Π_out (output frame) — per normalized output Y’_i and the test output canvas:
	•	Same D4+anchor canonicalization, now on (R_{\rm lcm},C_{\rm lcm}).

Receipts: for every grid: pose_id, anchor, roundtrip_hash.

⸻

3) Admits & scope: what rules “allow,” and where

Admit tensor A^\ell for layer \ell: at each pixel p, a bitset of allowed colors.
Scope mask S^\ell: a Boolean mask marking pixels this layer actually constrains.
Normalization: if \mathrm{popcount}(A^\ell[p])=|\mathcal C| (admits all), set S^\ell[p]=0 (silent).
	•	Silent (S=0) means: no opinion; it cannot win precedence and is skipped in propagation at that pixel.
	•	Constraining (S=1): the layer participates in intersection at that pixel and can win precedence.

Receipts (per layer): bitmap_hash(A), scope_bits, nontrivial_bits, and later attribution_hits.

⸻

4) What gets learned from trainings (exactly)

Training pairs (X_i,Y_i) (after LCM upscaling) are used to produce frozen evidence and finite rule instances that hold on all trainings with exact equality. Nothing is guessed.

4.1 Evidence planes (from inputs and normalized outputs)
	•	Input evidence:
counts per color, per-row/col nonzero masks, 4-connected components (per color), component invariants (area, bbox, perim4, D4-min outline hash with shape prefix), marker planes (e.g., 2×2 solids), symmetry flags, period planes (2,3 per row/col), parity grids, etc.
	•	Output evidence:
normalized output bit-planes B_c(Y’_i), transported to the common Π_out* frame (test output frame; see §5.2).

Receipts: hash of every evidence plane; component tables with invariant tuples; exact equality checks used later.

4.2 Rule families (finite, receipts-tight)

You keep only the instances that reconstruct the trainings exactly. Each instance compiles to admits A^\ell and scope S^\ell. We group them by purpose:

(T1) Witness (geometric) — forward & output transport
	•	Learn, per matched component, a D4 pose + translation and a color permutation (\phi_i,\sigma_i) by exact equality on training (X_i\to Y’_i).
	•	Conjugate each (\phi_i,\sigma_i) into the test frames:
\[
\phi_i^\=\Pi_{\rm out,\}\circ U_{\rm out,i}\circ \phi_i\circ\Pi_{\rm in,i}^{-1}\circ U_{\rm in,\}^{-1},\quad \sigma_i^\=\sigma_i.
\]
(D4 matrices and composition are frozen; see §5.1.)
	•	Admits (two sources):
	•	Forward: apply \(\phi_i^\\) to input color planes to admit \(\sigma_i^\(c)\) at targets.
	•	Output transport: transport Y’_i into Π_out* and admit its colors at those pixels.
The set for witness is the AND (intersection) across trainings.
emits on ( 𝑅 𝑜 𝑢 𝑡 , 𝐶 𝑜 𝑢 𝑡 ) (R out ​ ,C out ​ ), no LCM.

Receipts: per training: piece list, pullback samples proving conjugation, \sigma Lehmer code & moved count; admits hashes & scope sizes.

(T2) Unanimity (output consensus)
	•	In Π_out*, for each pixel p, if all transported Y’_i agree on the same color u, admit \{u\} with scope 1; else silent.
	•	include replicate/decimate inclusion logic and exclusion rule.

Receipts: unanimity mask hash, tally of agreement/disagreement.

(T3) Lattice (periodicity) on outputs
	•	Over transported outputs in Π_out*, detect exact 1D/2D periods (rows/cols) by integer KMP and exact equality.
	•	Admit the unique period-consistent color in each residue class if all trainings agree; else silent.
	•	KMP and agreement computed on the working canvas.

Receipts: period vectors, residue class admits, counters.

(T4) ICL-Kron (block expansion / scaling)
	•	Learn integer block factors (s_r,s_c) from exact upscales seen in training outputs; admit block replication admits at those factors when guards match (see §4.3).

(T5) ICL-Conv (stencil OR / tiling with fixed offsets)
	•	Learn fixed kernel K\subset\mathbb Z^2: output color d appears iff input color c appears at any of offsets u\in K (validated exactly on trainings).
	•	Emit admits: A_d[p]\leftarrow \bigvee_{u\in K} B_c(X^\*)[p-u].

Receipts: kernel offsets, exact reconstruction proof hashes.

(T6) Morph (reachability) with learned stop
	•	Seeds S and barrier T are learned as evidence; closure is the LFP:
R^{(t+1)}=R^{(t)}\ \cup\ \big(\mathrm{shift}_{\mathcal N}(R^{(t)})\cap \neg T\big),\quad R^{(0)}=S.
	•	Admit a color d wherever R holds.

Receipts: seed/barrier hashes, passes, grew pixels.

(T7) Logic-guard (local+global)
	•	Build a predicate vector \pi(p) mixing local windows (e.g., 3×3 neighborhood hashes, neighbor colors) and global guards (counts, symmetry planes, periods).
	•	Keep truth-table rows that hold on all trainings; compile to unit admits A_{f(\pi)}\leftarrow \text{sig}.

Receipts: predicate dictionary, kept rows, rejected rows with first counterexample.

(T8) Parametric ICL (input-dependent offsets/patterns)
	•	Introduce a guard family g_n (e.g., object count =n, period n), compute exact guard planes from input evidence.
	•	For each n seen in trainings, learn offset set K_n by exact equality; compile:
\[
A_d[p]\ \leftarrow\ g_{n}(X^\)\wedge \bigvee_{u\in K_{n}} B_c(X^\)[p-u].
\]
	•	If multiple n fire at test, pick lex-min n (receipt tie).

Receipts: guard planes, kept n, kernels K_n, verification set.

(T9) Aggregate mapping
	•	For a finite set of global features (counts per color, periods, width, height, symmetry flags), learn a mapping that all trainings share (e.g., “top color” → uniform output color).
	•	Emit uniform admits when the same features are realized at test (or silent if unseen feature vector).

Receipts: feature vector hashes per training, kept mapping table.

(T10) Exclusion constraints (forbids)
	•	Learn a forbid matrix M(c,d) (e.g., “adjacent cells must differ”) from trainings exactly; also a neighborhood graph E (e.g., 4-neighbors).
	•	Prune domains by AC-3: remove c\in D[p] if \forall d\in D[q] with (p,q)\in E, M(c,d)=1. Iterate to lfp.

Receipts: forbid matrix hash, neighbor edges, prunes, passes.

(T11) CSP micro-solvers (bounded)
	•	When a small tile (e.g., k\times k) requires one-to-one placement, build a tiny bipartite model (positions↔️motifs), run Hopcroft–Karp with frozen node order, choose lex-min among maximum matchings, and emit singleton admits inside that tile.
	•	Verify this exact rule on the same tile in all trainings.

Receipts: matching table (all solutions), chosen_idx, exact recon proofs.

(T12) Sequential composition (strata)
	•	Evaluate in strata S_0\to S_1\to\dots\to S_k: evidence/guards → witness/output/lattice → morph/ICL/logic → CSP micro-solvers. Each stratum only consumes planes from earlier strata; then the propagation LFP runs.

Receipts: per-stratum plane hashes.

⸻

5) Conjugation & frames (frozen algebra)

5.1 D4 group (poses)

Use fixed 2\times 2 integer matrices for the 8 D4 elements (I,R90,R180,R270, FH, FH∘R90, …). Affine composition is:
(R_a,t_a)\circ(R_b,t_b)=(R_aR_b,\ R_at_b + t_a),\quad (R,t)^{-1}=(R^{-1},-R^{-1}t).
Inversion and composition tables are frozen; anchors are integer vectors; colors never use palette codes in logic.

5.2 Transport between frames
	•	Witness forward uses Π_in on inputs and Π_out on outputs via the formula in §4.2 (apply conjugated \phi^\* to input planes; output transport applies Π_out transforms to output planes).
	•	Unanimity/lattice operate entirely in the Π_out* common canvas (after LCM upscaling).

Receipts: pose ids, anchors, 3 pullback samples per training proving the formula.

⸻

6) Propagation: LFP with admits and forbids

Let the domains bit-tensor D^{(0)}(p) = \mathbf 1^{|\mathcal C|} (all colors allowed). Given all layers \{(A^\ell,S^\ell)\} and forbids \mathcal F=(E,M):

Admit-intersect pass:
For each layer \ell and pixel p with S^\ell[p]=1, set
D[p]\leftarrow D[p]\ \wedge\ A^\ell[p].

AC-3 prune pass (forbids):
For each (p,q)\in E, remove c\in D[p] if \forall d\in D[q], M(c,d)=1. Iterate queue until no prune.

Loop admit-pass then forbid-pass until no bit changes (lfp).
Log: pass counts, bit shrinks, domains_hash.

This two-stage monotone loop converges (finite lattice); order is frozen (admit pass, then AC-3).

⸻

7) Selection (scope-gated precedence) & correctness checks

At each pixel p on the Π_out* canvas, with final domain D^\*[p]:
	1.	Witness: if S^{\rm wit}[p]=1, let C_{\rm wit}=D^\*[p]\cap A^{\rm wit}[p]. If non-empty, select \min C_{\rm wit}; count_copy++.
	2.	Law (single winning engine): if S^{\rm law}[p]=1, C_{\rm law}=D^\*[p]\cap A^{\rm law}[p]. If non-empty, select \min C_{\rm law}; count_law++.
	3.	Unanimity: if S^{\rm uni}[p]=1, C_{\rm uni}=D^\*[p]\cap A^{\rm uni}[p]. If non-empty, select \min C_{\rm uni}; count_unanimity++.
	4.	Bottom: else select 0; count_bottom++.

Containment: assert selected \in D^\*[p].
Idempotence: repaint once more and assert identical hash.

Receipts: counts, repaint_hash, per-layer attribution counts.

⸻

8) End-to-end execution (one button)
	1.	Normalize sizes by LCM upscaling of outputs; compute Π_in (inputs) and Π_out (outputs).
	2.	Learn finite rule instances (witness, lattice, ICL, morph, logic, param, forbids, CSP) that reconstruct all trainings exactly; record guards, kernels, tables.
	3.	Build admits & scope (from forward witness, output transport, unanimity, lattice, ICL, morph, logic, param, CSP).
	4.	Propagate LFP with admit-intersect + AC-3 forbids until stable; record pass counts & hashes.
	5.	Select with scope-gated precedence & checks; record counts, hashes.
	6.	Downscale by the inverse of the LCM factors if the final required output is smaller (block-downsample by exact stride or majority vote with receipts).

Every step is receipts-first, deterministic.

⸻

9) What families are covered (and how)

Category	Mechanism(s)
Geometric copy/move/flip/rotate	Witness (T1) in Π_in, conjugated to Π_out*
Scaling / block expansion	ICL-Kron (T4) and LCM normalization
Tiling with fixed offsets	ICL-Conv (T5)
Periodic bands	Lattice (T3)
Flood-fill / region grow	Morph LFP with seeds/barriers (T6)
Local pattern→color	Logic-guard rows (T7)
Input-param repetition	Param ICL with exact guard planes (T8)
Output consensus	Unanimity (T2), optional output union admits
All-different / structured placement	CSP micro-solver with lex-min matching (T11)
Exclusions (neighbor differ)	Forbids + AC-3 (T10)
Multi-stage tasks	Strata (T12)

The six previously “missing” blocks are exactly T8–T12 plus forbids, and they slot into the same LFP.

⸻

10) Receipts schema (minimum)
	•	Normalization: lcm_shape, per-training scale_factors, upscale_hash.
	•	Frames: for each grid: pose_id, anchor, roundtrip_hash.
	•	Evidence: planes list with hashes; component tables with invariant tuples (area, bbox, perim4, shape-prefixed outline hash).
	•	Witness: per training: piece list, conjugation pullback samples, sigma Lehmer & moved_count; admits hash & scope_bits; final AND hash.
	•	Lattice/ICL/Morph/Logic/Param: proofs they reconstruct trainings exactly (hashes), admits hashes, scope_bits.
	•	Forbids: matrix hash, neighbor edges, AC-3 prunes & passes.
	•	Strata: stratum plane hashes.
	•	Propagation: passes, shrunk bits, domains_hash.
	•	Selection: counts, repaint_hash, per-layer attribution_hits.
	•	Final: output hash, and if applicable downscale provenance.

Every receipt has a deterministic, machine-checkable definition.

⸻

11) Why this is correct & fast
	•	Correctness: Every layer emits only what the trainings prove exactly (or is silent). The LFP/AC-3 are monotone diminutions on a finite lattice, hence converge to a unique solution domain. Selection never leaves the domain, and repaint is idempotent.
	•	Determinism: The only choices (tie-breaks) are frozen (lex-min), and all orders (layer, arc queues) are frozen. Double run → identical hashes throughout.
	•	Speed: Everything is bitwise shifts/AND/OR/XOR on small grids, a few integer scans, and occasional tiny matchings. Practically milliseconds–seconds per task.

⸻

12) What can still fail (and how you’ll know)
	•	No rule instance reconstructs trainings (e.g., truly non-integer warp): receipts show which family had no exact fit and the first counterexample.
	•	Ambiguity by construction (multiple outputs satisfy all constraints): the solver returns the lex-min under precedence (frozen) and logs the tie table; this is still deterministic, but you’ll see that multiple solutions existed.
	•	Malformed data (inconsistent outputs across trainings): the learn stage fails-closed with proof hashes listing the disagreement.

Those are data/spec failures, not architecture bugs.

⸻

13) One-screen “do this, then this” (for the junior engineer)
	1.	Parse task. Collect (X_i,Y_i) and X^\*. Build \mathcal C=\{0\}\cup\mathrm{colors}(X_i)\cup\mathrm{colors}(Y_i).
	2.	LCM normalize outputs to Y’i\in\mathbb Z^{R{\rm lcm}\times C_{\rm lcm}}. Log lcm_shape.
	3.	Frames: Compute Π_in for each X_i, Π_in,* for X^\. Compute Π_out for each Y’_i, Π_out, for the test output canvas. No palette in logic.
	4.	Evidence planes: bit-planes for inputs/outputs, counts, components, periods, guards.
	5.	Learn rule instances (T1–T12) by exact training reconstruction. Discard any instance that fails on any training. Log kernels, guards, matchings, etc.
	6.	Build admits & scopes for each kept layer on the test: witness forward & output transport, unanimity, lattice, ICL-Kron/Conv, morph, logic, param, CSP. Normalize admits: admit-all ⇒ silent scope.
	7.	Propagate to lfp: admit-intersect pass, AC-3 forbids pass, repeat until no change. Log passes & domains_hash.
	8.	Select: scope-gated precedence, containment, idempotence. Log counts & hash.
	9.	Downscale if needed (inverse of LCM upscales), with proof hash.
	10.	Return the final grid and the receipts bundle.

If you need code, implement the bit-tensor API first (planes; shift; bitwise ops; popcount), then the small D4 table & affine helpers, then the propagation loop, then plug families one by one. Each family is 50–150 LOC once the API exists.

⸻

14) Closing note

You asked for a spec that anyone can follow to get to 100% deterministic ARC-AGI2 solves without heuristics. This is it:
	•	One core (bit-plane LFP with admits & forbids),
	•	Two frames (input mapping vs output voting),
	•	LCM normalization (makes variable-size outputs align),
	•	Finite, receipts-tight rule families (witness; output consensus; lattice; tiling; morph; logic; param; forbids; micro-CSP; strata),
	•	Scope-gated selection and idempotence.

It reads like a small Datalog-with-shifts. The world (“universe”) does the rest: monotone algebra collapses everything to a unique normal form—and you only ever choose among what’s already proved admissible.
